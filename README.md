# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio GitHub repository! As a passionate beginner in the field of data science, I am thrilled to showcase my journey and the projects I have undertaken to explore the fascinating world of data. From simple data visualizations to more complex machine learning models, this repository reflects my dedication to learning and applying data science concepts. As I continue to evolve and grow, I hope this portfolio serves as a testament to my enthusiasm for data-driven insights and my eagerness to contribute meaningfully to this ever-expanding domain. Join me on this exciting adventure of discovery and innovation in data science!
# Data Science Projects:
1)**[Loan Approval Prediction](https://nbviewer.org/github/AdamFeddoui/Data_Science_Projects/blob/c3afa3881dd9b27ba9b3c19f244b722fe06a6729/loan_analysis/loan_approval_classs.ipynb)**    
 * **Description**: This model predicts whether our loan would be approved (1) or Rejected (0) based on several features.  
 * **Models used**: Logistic Regression, XGboost, DecisionTrees, RandomForest, KNN  
 * **Results**: XGboost and RandomForest gave the best results (97% accuracy)

2)**[Wine Quality Prediction](https://nbviewer.org/github/AdamFeddoui/Data_Science_Projects/blob/1ecdd6b839fb2b5e209b3d5d57234cbdc5ebfa65/Wine%20Quality%60/winequality_class.ipynb)**
 * **Description**: This model predicts whether our Wine has a good quality ( 1) or a bad one (0)
 * **Models used**: Logistic Regression, XGboost, DecisionTrees, RandomForest, KNN  
 * **Results**: XGboost and RandomForest gave the best results (85% accuracy)
